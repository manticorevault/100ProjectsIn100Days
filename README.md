# 100ProjectsIn100Days

100ProjectsIn100Days is the way I found to develop my programming skills and my discipline. There's only one rule to the project:  Code at least on project per day.

PROJECT LIST - 

Day 1 - Random Phrases Game
- In this project I recreated a game from my childhood. In this game, me and my friends selected 5 persons we liked, 5 "throwing" verbs,
  5 objects, 5 parts of the human body and 5 persons we DISliked. Then we randomly selected one item from each list and generated a new, 
  non-sense phrase. It was really funny back in the days, and I decided it was a good way to begin this project!
